## Design and Developer Notes

Some people have difficulty using menu systems due to mobility or cognitive issues. Providing an alternative form of navigation helps people to locate information more easily. Alternative forms of navigation include a search facility or (less commonly) a site map.

## Testing Notes

In addition to the primary navigation, there needs to an an alternative method to find content anywhere on the site. This is normally a search field but it could also be a site map.

### Steps to check

Check that each page with a navigation menu also has a search facility or site map. Note that pages which are in a step process (e.g. a registration journey) do not need to be directly accessible via the alternative navigation.

**Impact range:** Medium
