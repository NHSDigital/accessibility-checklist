## Design and Developer Notes

Components that have the same functionality within a set of Web pages are identified consistently.

A consistent naming convention for frequently used components (e.g. home page link or submit button) helps users to understand and use content more easily.

## Testing Notes

Check that the visual and/or programmatic labels of interactive elements which have the same function are consistent across all pages.
