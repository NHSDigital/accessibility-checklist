## Design Notes

When the keyboard focus indicator is visible, an area of the focus indicator meets all the following:

- is at least as large as the area of a 2 CSS pixel thick perimeter of the unfocused component or sub-component, and
- has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the same pixels in the focused and unfocused states.

## Developer Notes

Reliant on design influence.

## Testing Notes

### Steps to check

- Check the focusable element to make sure that the text background and border have sufficient contrast.
- Make sure that the focus indicator is thick enough to be visible by all users.
