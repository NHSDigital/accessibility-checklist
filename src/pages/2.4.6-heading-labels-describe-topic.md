## Content and Design Notes

### Provide descriptive headings and labels

Headings and form labels should help people to understand page structure, find content and complete tasks.

Headings must clearly indicate the topic or purpose of the content in that page section. Labels must indicate the purpose of the field to which they relate. They should also be positioned adjacent to the field (ideally above).

Descriptive headings and clear labels are especially helpful for users with difficulty reading or for those with limited short-term memory. They also help users navigating using a screen reader.

#### Descriptive headings

The H1 is the same as the page title. You should have only 1 H1 on a page.

Each main section of your page should start with an H2 and each sub-section of an H2 with an H3. It is possible to have sub-sub-sections which start with an H4.

With each heading, ask yourself if it's a sub-section of the previous heading. If not, it should be at the same level as (or higher than) the previous section.

Make sure that headings follow the correct "nesting" order and don't skip levels. The structure of the page is the key thing, not the size and style of the text.

#### Descriptive labels

Make sure that every form field has a label that tells users what information they need to enter.

Put the label next to the form field so that the user is clear which field it relates to.

Generally the label should be visible.

Give grouped items a "legend".

## Developer Notes

Reliant on design influence.

## Testing Notes

### Headings and labels clearly describe the topic or purpose

Identify headings and labels in page and check whether the content accurately describes the page section and form field, respectively
