## Design and Developer Notes

Video content may not be seen by people who are visually impaired so an alternative track is essential so that everyone can understand the visual
information that is being conveyed. Sometimes it's necessary to create two versions; one with audio description, and one without.

## Testing Notes

If video content is present on the page and contains visual information that is useful to the user, this information must also be conveyed through audio.

### Steps to check

Check any video content and assess whether important visual content has an audio description.

Ensure the audio description matches the visual content.
