## Design Notes

None

## Developer Notes

### Use the appropriate autocomplete token for form fields that collect personal information

Enable extra support for personalisation, such as familiar terms and symbols which are needed for users with cognitive disabilities to use the web — in particular completing forms.

If a user agent, either the browser or assistive technology knows what a control does then it can potentially provide the extra support where required.

Adding autocomplete can significantly simplify and speed up the filling in of forms for all users — for example, reducing the numbers of interactions required to complete a form is helpful for both a busy commuter who only has one hand free as well as users with some form of cognitive impairment.

## Testing Notes

### Autocomplete is used on inputs when appropriate

The purpose of each input field collecting information about the user can be programmatically determined.  If a user agent, either the browser or assistive technology knows what a control does then it can potentially provide the extra support required.

Developers should implement this for forms (unless this would compromise security).

As an example, the First Name field of a form would be marked up using: `autocomplete="given-name"`

#### Details for autocomplete

The purpose of each input field collecting information about the user can be programmatically determined when:

- The input field serves a purpose identified in the [Input Purposes for User Interface Components WCAG Section](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#input-purposes); and
- The content is implemented using technologies with support for identifying the expected meaning for form input data

#### Steps to check

- Run automated tool and check results
- Alternatively, check with developers

**Impact range: Medium - High**

**Test type: Semi-automated** (automated checks will identify where autocomplete has not been used, but this requires review)

**Tool:**
