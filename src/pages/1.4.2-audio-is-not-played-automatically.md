## Design and Developer Notes

### Ensure audio doesn’t auto-play

When creating interface designs, avoid including components which auto-play audio.

When audio content plays automatically and doesn’t stop after a couple of seconds, people using screen readers will find it difficult to hear software announcements. If you must include audio, provide a way to control the audio — allow the user to pause/stop it easily. This enables blind and partially sighted people to choose how and when they listen to your audio content.

## Testing Notes

### Audio is not played automatically

If any audio on a Web page plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level
