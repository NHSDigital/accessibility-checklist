## Developer Notes

### Don’t use 'Down' events for links/buttons unless there is a cancel method

It should be easy for users to abort or undo accidental link or button activation. When such an activation occurs the user has the opportunity to abort or undo.

## Testing Notes

### 'Down' events for links/buttons are not used unless there is a cancel method

Down events for links/buttons are not used (unless there’s a cancel method)

#### Technical detail

For functionality that can be operated using a single pointer, at least one of the following is true:

- No down event: the down event of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function;
- Abort or undo: completion of the function is on the up-event, and a mechanism is available to abort the function before completion or to undo the function after completion;
- Up reversal: the up-event reverses any outcome of the preceding down-event;
- Essential: completing the function on the down event is essential

#### Steps to check

- Ask developers, or click down on each target, move off, and release
