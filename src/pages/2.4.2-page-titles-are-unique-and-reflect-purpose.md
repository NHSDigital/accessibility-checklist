## Implementation Notes

### Provide page titles that describes the purpose of the page

Providing clear and informative page titles help people understand if the content on the page is relevant to them. Descriptive page titles help everyone find content on your website and understand where they are within the website hierarchy.

Best practice is to have the page purpose followed by the name of the application/site

Page name - Application/site name
