## Design Notes

Design decisions are not relevant.

## Developer Notes

### Setting language codes

Identifying the human language of the page exposes the content of the page to user agents and assistive technologies with more accuracy â€” including correct pronunciation of words and display of characters.

For example `<html lang="en">`

If a webpage has content in more than one language, set the page to the language that is used the most.
