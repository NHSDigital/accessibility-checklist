## Developer Notes

### Setting language codes

Identifying the human language of the page exposes the content of the page to user agents and assistive technology with more accuracy — including correct pronunciation of words and display of characters.

For example `<html lang="en">`

It's also important to set the language code on parts of text. If your pages contain multiple languages, use the lang attribute with the relevant language code to identify changes in the language.

For example `<p lang="fr">Ceci est écrit en français</p>`
