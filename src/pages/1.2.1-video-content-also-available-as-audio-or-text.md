## Design Notes

### Ensure all essential content that is communicated visually in videos is also available as audio or text

If you are using a video on its own (in other words, if you do not repeat the content elsewhere on the page), you should also provide a transcript. The transcript should include all the dialogue, relevant sound effects, and visual content.

If the video includes dialogue, it should also have captions.

If the video relies on visual content to convey information (for example, diagrams without a verbal description), it's best to include an audio description. This isn't essential but you should provide have a transcript.
