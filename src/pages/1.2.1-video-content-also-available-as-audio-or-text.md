## Design Notes

### Ensure all essential content that is communicated visually in videos is also available as audio or text

If you are using a video on its own (in other words, if you do not repeat the content elsewhere on the page), you should also provide a transcript. The transcript should include all the dialogue, relevant sound effects, and visual content.

If the video relies on visual content to convey information (for example, diagrams without a verbal description), it's best to include an audio description. This isn't essential but you should provide have a transcript.

## Developer Notes

Ensure that the video player or page has a link (or similar) where users can access a transcript or audio description. This should be near the video content and accurately described.

## Testing Notes

Text transcripts or audio descriptions are provided to accompany and therefore explain video content.

### Steps to check — Transcript

- Identify video content
- Check if a transcript/audio description has been provided
- If so, does transcript include: sound effects, music and other significant background sound (e.g. laughter) and identify different speakers
- Is transcript easily accessible from the same content block as the video content
- Is the transcript itself in an accessible format — such as well formatted HTML
