## Design Notes

### Don’t only rely on colour to convey information

Colour should not be used as the only method of conveying information as blind and partially sighted people may struggle to understand information presented in this way. To communicate with people who cannot see well or distinguish colours, provide an additional cue

- provide text in addition to colour changes
- use multiple visual cues such as patterns, strokes and emboldening of text

For example, using labels or distinctive patterns (e.g. hatching) helps to distinguish different areas on graphs.

Not relying on colour vision helps users who: are colour blind, need to over-ride default colours or have difficulty seeing the difference between colours — for example are viewing content in bright sunlight.
