## Design Notes

Design decisions are not relevant.

## Developer Notes

Inline CSS is where CSS code has been added into HTML elements. This must be avoided and CSS code should be placed in the style sheet proper. 
An example of inline CSS is: 

`<h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">This is a heading</h1>`

where the style of the heading is added into the code. 

## Testing Notes

### Steps to check

Inspect the code to ensure inline CSS has not been used.
