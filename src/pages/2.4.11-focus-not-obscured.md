## Design Notes

### When a user interface component receives keyboard focus, the component is not entirely hidden due to author-created content

A persistent header or footer can completely obscure focus, so if these elements are present they should be small enough to ensure they won't obscure page content in focus while a user is tabbing through the page.

## Developer Notes

Ensure that focus is unobscured by other content at all times.

## Testing Notes

### Steps to check

Tab through the page to see if the focus is completely visible for all content. Look for content which might obscure the focus indicator.
