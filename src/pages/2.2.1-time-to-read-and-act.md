Where a time constraint is in place, there is enough time for users to read and interact with content.

## Design and Developer Notes

### Provide users with enough time to complete an action or task

People with cognitive impairments or those using assistive technologies may need more time to interact with content especially when filling out forms or reading sections of content. If time limits are set for these activities, users may not be able to complete the task in the required time.

Avoid setting time limits for users in designs. If this is unavoidable, provide a way to extend the time or turn the time restriction off — for example, show a time-out warning message in an accessible modal window and allow users to extend their time via a button.

#### Information and tools

- [Accessible Timeout Notifications](https://tink.uk/accessible-timeout-notifications/)

## Testing Notes

### There is time to read and act on things

For each time limit that is set by the content, at least one of the following is true:

- Turn off: The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or
- Adjust: The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or
- Extend: The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, "press the space bar"), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times

#### Exceptions detail

- Real-time Exception: The time limit is a required part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or
- Essential Exception: The time limit is essential and extending it would invalidate the activity; or
- 20 Hour Exception: The time limit is longer than 20 hours

#### Steps to check — A

- Open web page
- Identify content which is shown for a limited time — e.g. an auto-updating carousel
- Check that the time limit can be turned off or adjusted in advance, or extended as needed e.g. by interacting with a pause button

#### Steps to check — B

Ask site author if there is any automated time out functionality for website — such as on forms for security purposes. Confirm, after how much time and where this functionality is

- Open a web page with time-out, if it's a form, complete a few fields/steps then leave idle
- Check back in X minutes time (as specified)
- If a time-out message is displayed, confirm there is an option for the user to extend
- Complete aforementioned steps (A and B) using keyboard interaction only and note any barriers
