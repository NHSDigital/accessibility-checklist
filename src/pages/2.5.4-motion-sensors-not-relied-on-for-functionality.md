## Design Notes

### Donâ€™t rely on motion sensors

Some people with disabilities may not be able to easily move their device.

Functions that are triggered by moving the device (shaking or tilting) or by gesturing towards the device so that sensors or the camera can interpret the gestures, should also be designed so they can be activated via user interface components, unless the motion is essential for the function and not using it would invalidate the activity.

## Developer Notes

Reliant on design influence.

## Testing Notes

### Motion sensors are not relied on for functionality (e.g. shake to undo)

Motion sensors are not relied on.

Functionality that can be operated by device motion or user motion can also be operated by user interface components and responding to the motion can be disabled to prevent accidental actuation, except when:

- Supported Interface: The motion is used to operate functionality through an accessibility supported interface
- Essential: The motion is essential for the function and doing so would invalidate the activity

#### Steps to check

- Any feature that uses motion actuation should have another method of use

**Impact range:** Medium - Low

**Test type:** Manual
