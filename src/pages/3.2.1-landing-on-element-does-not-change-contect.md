## Design Notes

### Ensure users have control over context changes

All functionality should be predictable when people are navigating their way through a page.

Just navigating to, or changing the state of, a control should not cause anything surprising to happen. For example, on navigating to a radio button, the user focus should not be automatically moved elsewhere. Similarly, selecting a radio button should not automatically submit a form or otherwise trigger significant changes to a page.

Ensure submit buttons are provided for all forms. Don't indicate automated submissions or significant changes to pages in designs.

## Developer Notes

### Don’t unexpectedly change context in response to a onFocus or onChange event

All functionality should be predictable when people are navigating their way through a page.

All users, but particularly those using assistive technology, benefit from pages which behave predictably. When building pages, avoid implementing functionality which automatically triggers significant changes to the page — such as: automatically submitting forms or moving keyboard focus.

Don't write JavaScript which includes significant automatic changes. Instead, request an updated interface design, where appropriate  — for example ensuring a submit button is provided for form designs.

## Testing Notes

### Landing on an element does not change the context

When any user interface component receives focus, make sure it does not initiate a change of context. For example, tabbing to a form field element does not automatically trigger a form submission or other significant change to the page.

#### Steps to check

- place cursor in the browser address bar
- use the keyboard Tab key to progress through interactive page elements (e.g. links, buttons, form inputs) until you reach the end of the document
- make sure there are no unexpected changes of context as any of the elements receive focus

**Impact range:** Medium
