## Design Notes

### Ensure forms have adequate labels and instructions for user to know how to complete a form

Provide clear instructions and descriptive labels for form fields to help people understand how to enter information into a web page.

### Form labels should always be visible

Ensure a clear label is provided for all form fields in designs and the label persists when users interact with the form field. Indicating in designs that the placeholder should be used as the label is not sufficient.

Placeholders disappear when a user starts typing, they don't have full browser support and relying on them can make it hard for users to check their answers before submitting a form.
