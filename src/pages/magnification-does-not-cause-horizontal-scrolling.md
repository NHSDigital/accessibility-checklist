## Design Notes

### Ensure users of magnification software do not have to unnecessarily scroll horizontally to find content (Best practice)

Design interfaces that consider users of screen magnification software.

Consider setting a maximum width for the main body content of pages and favour a single column, vertical arrangement of important information over the horizontal.

Position feedback close to the control which triggered the response. For example, position error messages immediately next to (ideally above) the form input field in error
