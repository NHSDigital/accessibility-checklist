## Design Notes

### Design for landscape and portrait orientation

All content and functionality should be available regardless of the display orientation (portrait or landscape).

Designing for both orientations helps users who rely on their devices being mounted in a fixed orientation e.g. on the arm of a power wheelchair.

If a user favours a landscape orientation for their device, there will be less vertical space available and headers, footers and other potentially fixed elements might need to be un-fixed in designs.

## Developer Notes

### Donâ€™t lock device orientation

All content and functionality should be available regardless of the device display orientation (portrait or landscape). Some users will mount their device in a specific orientation (e.g. on the arm of a wheelchair).

Websites and apps need to support both orientations by making sure the website design accommodates both orientations.

## Testing Notes

### Orientation is not locked

Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is essential

#### Steps to check

- open page on mobile device
- change device orientation (rotate device)
- check page responds to orientation

**Impact range:** High - Critical

**Test type:** Manual
