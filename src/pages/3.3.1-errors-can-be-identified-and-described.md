## Design Notes

### Ensure form errors can be identified by all users

Make sure that error messages clearly describe what went wrong and how to fix the problem.

Do not rely on colour changes alone to indicate issues. For example, simply adding a red border to an input field would not be accessible â€” a text description is also needed.

Include an error message wherever there's a problem with the input and check that it's visibly obvious that the message is connected to that input.

If you have an error summary at the top of a form, check that each error in the list has a link that moves the focus to the relevant form field. This helps users who rely on keyboard navigation.
