## Design/Developer Notes

### Donâ€™t use keyboard shortcuts unless users can override them

If a page uses single character key shortcuts, users should be able to turn off or reconfigure these to two or more characters. This helps users who rely on speech input to avoid accidentally triggering such shortcuts.

## Testing Notes

### Keyboard short cuts are not used, unless the user can override them

Keyboard shortcuts are not used, unless there is a way to switch off or remap them.

#### Technical detail

If a keyboard shortcut is implemented in content using only letter (including upper- and lower-case letters), punctuation, number, or symbol characters, then at least one of the following is true:

- Turn off: A mechanism is available to turn the shortcut off;
- Remap: A mechanism is available to remap the shortcut to use one or more non-printable keyboard characters (e.g. Ctrl, Alt, etc);
- Active only on focus: The keyboard shortcut for a user interface component is only active when that component has focus.

#### Steps to check

- Ask developer or try different keys to detect feature
