## Design Notes

### All functionality that uses a dragging movement for operation can be achieved by a single pointer without dragging

This is true unless dragging is essential or the functionality is determined by the user agent and not modified by the author.

This requirement applies to web content that interprets pointer actions (i.e. this does not apply to actions that are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology).

## Developer Notes

Reliant on design influence.

## Testing Notes

### Steps to check

Check to make sure that any content that requires a dragging motion can also be performed by a button press or equivalent.
