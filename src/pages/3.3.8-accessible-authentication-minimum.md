## Design / Developer Notes

### A cognitive function test MUST NOT be required for any step in an authentication process, unless specified criteria are met

An example of a cognitive function test of authentication process could be: 

- Remembering a password
- Helpful hints or questions
- Solving a puzzle or a capture to be able to log in

Note: It is allowed to have such a test if one of following is true:

1. An alternative method exists which does not require any of these details, such as allowing the paste function or offering the ability to log in through a third-party provider using the OAuth method
2. A mechanism is available to assist the user in completing the cognitive function test

## Testing Notes

### Steps to check

Check that:

1. There are no cognitive function tests required to log in
2. If such a test is present, a user has an alternate method of bypassing such tests, such as pasting a password or logging in through an alternate method
3. Make sure that JavaScript is not blocking the functionality of a browser agent that would allow a user to save their data, such as username and password, so they do not have to remember them all the time when entering the website.
