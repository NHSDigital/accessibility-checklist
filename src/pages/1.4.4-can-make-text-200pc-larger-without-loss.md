## Design and Developer Notes

### Ensure the interface us usable when text is re-sized to 200%

People in many different circumstances, particularly those with partial sight, will find content easier to read if the text size can be increased.

Give people the ability to resize the text on the page if they need to. When using zoom, users should be able to get text to at least 200%.

## Testing Notes

### You can make text at least 200% larger without losing content/functionality

Except for captions and images of text, text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.

#### Steps to check

- In Firefox, Go to View -> Zoom and check “Zoom Text Only”
- Press CMD + (CTRL + on Windows) to zoom in
- Zoom in to 200%
- Does the text size increase?
- Is all content still readable and functionality usable?
