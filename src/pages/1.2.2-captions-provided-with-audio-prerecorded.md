## Design Notes

### Ensure videos with audio have accurate captions

Pre-recorded video content must have captions that are synchronised with the audio content of the video. These captions also need to be accurate so auto-generated captions, such as those provided by YouTube need to be checked and edited for accuracy.

## Developer Notes

Ensure there is a button which enables captions on the video player.

## Testing Notes

### Captions are provided for video with audio

Captions are provided for all prerecorded audio content in synchronized media, except when the media is a media alternative for text and is clearly labeled as such.

#### Steps to check — Captions

- Identify video content
- If video content has audio, confirm captions have been provided
- Confirm if captions accurately convey audio information — including: sound effects, music and other significant background sound (e.g. laughter)
- For closed captions, confirm the control to turn on /off is also accessible e.g. keyboard operable
