Actions can be either reversible, checked or confirmed where legal commitments or financial transactions for users occur that modify or delete user-controllable data

## Design Notes

### Ensure legal and financial actions can be either reversed, checked or confirmed

When data is submitted leading to a legal commitment, financial transaction, or an update to personal data, provide the user with a chance to: review, correct, and confirm the information they have entered. This could be presented as an alert in a modal window or as an additional step in series of forms.

The interface design should help users understand the importance and impact of these checks in the context of completing a goal.

#### Common mistakes

An eCommerce or other transactional journey which doesn't display sales information so the user can confirm details or make changes.

## Developer Notes

Reliant on design influence.

## Testing Notes

Ensure that:

1. When filling in personal information or financial details, a user is able to check this information before submitting. 
2. The user may reverse decisions/actions within a reasonable time frame
