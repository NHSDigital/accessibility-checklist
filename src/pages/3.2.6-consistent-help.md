## Design Notes

If a web page contains any of the following help mechanisms, they must occur in the same order relative to other page content, unless a change is initiated by the user.

- Human contact details
- human contact mechanism
- Self-help option
- a fully automated contact mechanism

Make sure that the help information is placed consistently across pages, for instance in the header of the pages.

## Testing Notes

### Steps to check

1. Check that the help mechanisms are consistent across pages.
2. Check that this information contains contact details visually and programmatically. If help related information is placed in the header of 1 page and in the footer of the other, that could potentially cause confusion, since a user does not expect to find it there.

Note: If the page has not had any help information before, the issue is not relevant.
