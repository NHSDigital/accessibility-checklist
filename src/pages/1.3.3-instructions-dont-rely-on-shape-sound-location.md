## Design Notes

### Don't rely on colour or location

Don't rely on colour or location. E.g. "press the red button on the right".

Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, colour, size, visual location, orientation, or sound.

Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.
