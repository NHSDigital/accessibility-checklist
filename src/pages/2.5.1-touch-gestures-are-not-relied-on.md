## Design Notes

### Donâ€™t rely on touch gestures

Some people with disabilities may not be able to conduct complex gestures or be able to easily move their device.

Functionality that relies on the use of multipoint (two-finger pinch zoom, a split tap, a two/three finger tap or swipe ) or path-based gestures (swiping, dragging, or the drawing of a complex path) must also be operable with a single point activation.

## Developer Notes

Ensure there is an alternative to content which requires a touch gesture, for example a nearby button which disables this feature.

## Testing Notes

### Touch gestures (e.g. swipe) are not relied on

Touch gestures are not relied on (functionality can be used with mouse/keyboard).

All functionality that uses multipoint or path-based gestures for operation can be operated with a single pointer without a path-based gesture, unless a multipoint or path-based gesture is essential.

#### Steps to check

- Check that any gesture features (e.g. swipe left on carousel) work with a click or tap
