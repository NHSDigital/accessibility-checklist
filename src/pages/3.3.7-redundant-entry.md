## Design Notes

### Information previously entered by or provided to the user that is required to be entered again in the same process MUST be either auto-populated or available for the user to select

The above is essential except when:

1. Re-entering the information is essential
2. The information is required to ensure the security of the content
3. Previously entered information is no longer valid, such as shipping or billing addresses

If the previously entered information is no longer valid, there should be a checkbox confirming that, or an option must be provided to easily change that.

## Testing Notes

### Steps to check

Check that the previously entered information provided by a user can be selected or pre-populated by the system, so that a user is not required to enter it twice, unless absolutely necessary.

Check that, in the cases where the information is no longer valid, there is an option to change it.

**Impact range:** Medium

**Test type:** Manual
