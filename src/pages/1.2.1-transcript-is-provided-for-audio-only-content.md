## Design Notes

### Ensure audio-only content has a transcript

Audio-only content that has no video and communicates information (for example a podcast) should have a text transcript.

## Developer Notes

None

## Testing Notes

### A transcript is provided for audio only content

An alternative for time-based media [transcript] is provided that presents equivalent information for prerecorded audio-only content

#### Steps to check — Transcript
- Identify audio only content (e.g. podcast)
- Check if a transcript has been provided
- If so, does transcript include: sound effects, music and other significant background sound (e.g. laughter) and identify different speakers
- Is transcript easily accessible from the same content block as the audio content
- Is the transcript itself in an accessible format — such as well formatted HTML
