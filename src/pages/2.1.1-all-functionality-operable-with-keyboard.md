## Design Notes

Some people use keyboards or key emulators such as sip-and-puff software, on-screen keyboards and speech input software to access content.

All functionality provided by the interactive elements on the page must be able to be operated with a keyboard or keyboard interface.

## Developer Notes

### Ensure all functionality is operable with a keyboard

The easiest way to ensure keyboard operability is to use native, semantic HTML elements for controls:

- Use `<button>` and `<a>` elements over generic elements such as `<div>` and `<span>`. Doing so means you get several accessibility benefits 'for free' — such as keyboard interactions supported by default.

- shift-tab to reverse
- enter to follow links
- space to select form controls (such as checkboxes)
- arrow keys for radio buttons or tabs.
